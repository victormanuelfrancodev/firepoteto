# Game Instructions

Welcome to our exciting game where you control a little flame character with a joystick! Your goal is to catch falling ice cubes and small flames. Here's how to play:

## How to Play

- **Move the Flame**: Use the joystick to move your flame character across the screen.

- **Catch Ice and Fire**:
    - Ice Cubes: Capture these to fill your ice bar. But be careful, each ice cube you catch will make your flame character slide faster (increase in speed).
    - Little Flames: Catching these will help fill your fire bar. Each flame caught will make your flame character grow larger.

- **Watch Out for the Alien-Like Object**: If you touch this, the ice cubes and flames will start falling faster.

- **Winning the Game**: You win if you can fill both the ice and fire bars completely.

## Tips and Tricks

- **Balance is Key**: You need to strike a balance between catching ice and flames to manage your size and speed effectively.

- **Stay Alert**: The alien-like object can significantly increase the game's difficulty, so be prepared to move quickly.

Good luck, and have fun!
